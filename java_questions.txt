Question : Describe Some of the Functional Interfaces in the Standard Librar.
Answer : 
There are a lot of functional interfaces in the java.util.function package. The more common ones include, but are not limited to:

Function :  it takes one argument and returns a result
Consumer – it takes one argument and returns no result (represents a side effect)
Supplier – it takes no arguments and returns a result
Predicate – it takes one argument and returns a boolean
BiFunction – it takes two arguments and returns a result
BinaryOperator – it is similar to a BiFunction, taking two arguments and returning a result. 
                The two arguments and the result are all of the same types.

UnaryOperator – it is similar to a Function, taking a single argument and returning a result of the same type
