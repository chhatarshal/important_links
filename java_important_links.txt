Note: Map in java 8 is used to transform value from one form to another form.
The map call is simply used to transform a value to some other value

Note: Difference Between orElse and orElseGet()
 orElse will execute even condition is true of false but orElseGet() will only called if value is false or in else case 
 so orElse() could create objects which never used to


 Note: Difference between map and flatmap:

 Just like the map() method, we also have the flatMap() method as an alternative for transforming values.
 The difference is that map transforms values only when they are unwrapped whereas flatMap takes 
 a wrapped value and unwraps it before transforming it.
